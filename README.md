# Sustainable Open Source Business Models

How can we establish sustainable open source business models?

We are not asking for profit maximization but rather for
strategies to cover the costs of open source projects in the long term.

Are there already successful examples?
Is open source a contradiction to current capitalism
or do we only need a few small ingredients
to finance open source projects in the long term and sufficiently?
How can projects be independent of donations or
how can a long-term donation strategy take place
without begging and bureaucratic requests?
